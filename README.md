PWA stands for a progressive web app. This is an app built from the web technologies we all know and love, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but with a feel and functionality that rivals an actual native app. Thanks to a couple of smart additions, you can turn almost any website into a progressive web app. This means that you can build a PWA rather quickly, in regards to a native app thatâ€™s pretty difficult to develop. Plus, you can offer all the features of native apps, like push notifications, offline support, and much more.
